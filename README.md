## mtimewait

mtimewait is a simple script that will wait until a number of files haven't
been modified, according to their mtime properties, in a given time period.  I
created it because it's a bit of function that I kept finding myself wanting
and couldn't find an existing tool to do.

### Installation

Just copy the script into your PATH, e.g.

    sudo cp mtimewait /usr/local/bin/
